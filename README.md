# task-management-react-admin-panel

I have done admin panel for task management in react js, here you can add the new task, edit the new task and also can delete the task, I have store tast in localstorage so it will not remove after refresh the page.

Here is some step to run it in you local system:-

1) This is the my github repo link => https://github.com/hpdeveloment/task-management-react-admin-panel with the help of this link you need to clone the code in your local system.
2) After clone the code you need to open the project in you code editor like vscode and run the command npm install to install all required packeges for run the project.

 -> npm intall

 -> after complete npm intall run -> npm start 

-> wait some time

 After that you will be able to see the project in your browser and test it.
